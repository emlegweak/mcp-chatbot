This repository was originally based on the MCP-Chatbot repository [here](https://github.com/3choff/mcp-chatbot), which demonstrates how to integrate the Model Context Protocol (MCP) into a simple CLI chatbot. The implementation has been extended far beyond the original repository, but the initial baseline was provided by Edoardo Cilia under the MIT License.
